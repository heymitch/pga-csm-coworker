# Student Onboarding Playbook

## 6-Step Onboarding Flow

### Step 1: Detect New Student
- **Source:** #pga-sales-dopamine (primary) or #pga-payments (rare cases)
- Note: Student won't be in Slack yet and won't be assigned to a CSM yet
- Check closer name and payment plan (deposit vs. full enrollment)

### Step 2: Track Onboarding Notifications
Monitor #pga-student-onboarding for three notifications:
1. Student joined Slack + Private Channel created
2. Student assigned to CSM
3. Custom Success Path created (link in channel AND in AirTable view)

### Step 3: Create Welcome Loom
- **Deadline:** Within 3 hours of student joining (before Accountability Trio message at 6 hours)
- **Batching:** If 3+ new students, batch Looms together
- **Format:** Camera only (not screen share for intro)

**Intro Script (personalized, ~30 sec):**
"Welcome welcome @[Name]! We are thrilled to have you on board! Here's a quick welcome video to help you dive right in!"

**Steps to record:**
1. Select Camera Only → Video → Mic
2. Record quick personalized intro (student's name, excitement, first impression)
3. Attach evergreen "First 6 Steps" clip via Edit Video → Add Clip

**After sending:** Drop camera emoji on the #pga-sales-dopamine post

### Step 4: Check Enrollment Status
- **Fully enrolled (payment plan set up):** Proceed normally
- **On deposit ($1/$500/$1000):**
  - They have NOT set up a payment plan with their Closer
  - They are NOT a fully enrolled student
  - They CANNOT book a 1:1 Onboarding Call
  - If deposit >72 hours → contact Closer about student status

### Step 5: Check Program Agreement
- Open AirTable "All Contracts Pending" view
- Agreement is sent via PandaDoc (shows as from Dickie)
- **Deposit students won't have agreement yet** — only fully enrolled students receive it
- If enrolled + agreement sent but not signed:
  1. Relay to Closer/Enrollment Advisor
  2. Relay to Jamie Runion to confirm PandaDoc was sent/opened
- Students cannot book OB Call or receive coaching until signed

### Step 6: Monitor Progress
Track in AirTable that student moves through:
```
Enrolled → Joined Slack → Booked Onboarding Call → Completed Assignment 0 → ...
```
- Make sure they book Weekly Live PGA Meet & Greet (Monday 11AM ET)
- If not progressing but submitting assignments → possible email/automation issue → flag to Daniel and Jamie

## Auto-Messages Student Receives
1. **CSM Auto Welcome Message** in private channel — agreement link, Skool link, call booking + Meet & Greet links
2. **Internal Team Auto Welcome Messages**
3. **Accountability Trio Auto Message** — triggers 6 hours after joining Slack

## Accountability Trio Notes
- Katie manages all Trios
- Students opt in via form, grouped by Archetype:
  - Working full-time, want to start ghostwriting
  - Working full-time, have 1+ freelance client
  - Full-time freelancer with 1+ client
  - Retired/not working, want to start ghostwriting
- Once 3 students in same archetype submit → Slack group chat created (3 students + Katie)
- If Duo instead of Trio → likely a student email issue → Katie handles
