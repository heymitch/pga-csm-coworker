# Onboarding Students

Tell me a new student's name and what you know about them. I produce the Welcome Loom script, flag deposit/agreement issues, and track the 6-step flow.

## What I Need
- Student name
- Enrollment status: deposit ($1/$500/$1000) or fully enrolled
- Agreement signed? (if known)
- Any context from the closer (shared in #pga-sales-dopamine thread)

## What I Produce

### Welcome Loom Script
```
PERSONALIZED INTRO (~30 sec, camera only):
"Welcome welcome [Name]! We are thrilled to have you on board!
[One personal connection point if available from closer context].
Here's a quick welcome video to help you dive right in!"

→ Then attach your evergreen "First 6 Steps" clip via Edit Video → Add Clip
```

### Status Flags
```
⚠️ DEPOSIT: [Name] is on a $[X] deposit — not fully enrolled.
   Cannot book 1:1 OB Call until payment plan set up.
   If 72+ hours on deposit → contact Closer: [closer name]

⚠️ AGREEMENT: [Name] has not signed the Program Agreement.
   Cannot receive 1:1 coaching until signed.
   Escalation: Closer first → Jamie Runion (PandaDoc verification)

✅ READY: [Name] is fully enrolled + agreement signed → clear for OB Call
```

### Onboarding Checklist (I track this)
```
- [ ] Detected in #pga-sales-dopamine
- [ ] Slack joined + private channel created (#pga-student-onboarding confirms)
- [ ] Assigned to CSM
- [ ] Custom Success Path created (link in #pga-student-onboarding + AirTable)
- [ ] Welcome Loom sent → drop 🎥 on sales-dopamine post
- [ ] Deposit/enrollment status confirmed
- [ ] Agreement status confirmed
- [ ] Meet & Greet scheduled (Monday 11AM ET)
```

## Key Rules

- **Welcome Loom within 3 hours** — before Accountability Trio message fires at 6 hours
- **Batch 3+ Looms together** — don't break workflow for each one
- **Deposit students can't book OB calls** — I always flag this
- **Watch #pga-payments too** — rare cases come through there instead of #pga-sales-dopamine
