# Monitoring Slack Channels

I triage all PGA Slack channels so you focus on what needs your attention, not scanning everything.

## Workflow

- [ ] Step 1: Scan community channels (#share-wins, #rising-ghostwriters, #lessons-learned, #social-strategy)
- [ ] Step 2: Scan private student channels for unanswered messages
- [ ] Step 3: Flag posts needing CSM response (questions, requests, stalled conversations)
- [ ] Step 4: Draft celebration responses for #share-wins
- [ ] Step 5: Draft DM redirects for students messaging in DMs
- [ ] Step 6: Present triage summary: "X posts need your attention, Y wins to celebrate"

## How I Execute

### With Slack Access
Auto-scan all channels on priority order (assignments → private → questions → community → DMs). Flag and draft.

### Without Slack Access (Fallback)
CSM reports what they're seeing. I draft responses and suggest priority order.

## Key Rules

- **Priority order matters** — assignments first, then private channels, then questions, then community, then DMs
- **Never answer DMs** — always redirect to private channel
- **Redirect template:** "Hey @[student]! I'm trained to focus on the Slack community channels. Post this in your private channel or #ask-[relevant]-questions so everyone can benefit!"
- **Celebrate wins quickly** — a congrats in #share-wins costs nothing and means everything
- **Star important channels** — keep assignment channels and private channels at the top
