# Slack Channel Monitoring Playbook

## Daily Priority Order

Work through channels in this exact order:

### Priority 1: Assignment Reviews
1. #introduce-yourself
2. #submit-assignment-0 through #submit-assignment-9

Check for: New submissions from YOUR students that need feedback.

### Priority 2: Private Channels
- Each student's locked private channel
- Check for: Unanswered questions, requests, stalled conversations
- Team members in each channel: You, student, Dickie, Cole, Daniel, Katie, Andrew

### Priority 3: Question Channels
1. #ask-curriculum-questions
2. #ask-logistical-questions
3. #ask-niche-and-content-questions
4. #ask-tech-questions
5. #ask-sales-questions

Check for: Unanswered questions from any student (not just yours).

### Priority 4: Community Channels
- #check-announcements
- #share-wins (celebrate!)
- #lessons-learned
- #rising-ghostwriters
- #social-strategy
- #pga-alumni

Check for: Posts worth celebrating, students needing encouragement.

### Priority 5: DMs
- **NEVER answer in DMs**
- Redirect to private channel or appropriate question channel

## DM Redirect Templates

**Standard:**
```
Hey @[Student] sorry for the delay, I'm trained to only focus on the greater Slack Community and not the DMs, so be sure to ask your questions in the question channels!
```

**Gentle:**
```
Hey @[Student]! Great question — can you drop this in #ask-[relevant]-questions or your private channel? That way everyone can benefit from the answer!
```

## Channel Actions
