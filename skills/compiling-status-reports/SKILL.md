# Compiling Status Reports

I auto-generate your daily and weekly reports from AirTable data so you never hand-type another BOD.

## Workflow — BOD Report

- [ ] Step 1: Pull AirTable student data (active count, assignment stages)
- [ ] Step 2: Format using BOD template (first month vs. standard)
- [ ] Step 3: Post to #ghostwriting-success-ops
- [ ] Step 4: Flag any anomalies (sudden drops, inactive students)

## Workflow — EOD Report

- [ ] Step 1: Compile day's activities (calls completed, assignments reviewed, messages sent)
- [ ] Step 2: Format EOD summary
- [ ] Step 3: Post to #ghostwriting-success-eod

## Workflow — EOW Loom Script

- [ ] Step 1: Aggregate week's metrics and highlights
- [ ] Step 2: Generate talking points (wins, challenges, projections)
- [ ] Step 3: Draft script for Loom recording

## Workflow — KPI Projections

- [ ] Step 1: Analyze each student's trajectory (assignment velocity, weeks in program, archetype)
- [ ] Step 2: Project EEC launches, client landings, Liftoff upsells
- [ ] Step 3: Identify top names for each milestone
- [ ] Step 4: Format projection report

## How I Execute

### With AirTable + Slack Access
Auto-pull all data, generate reports, post directly (with CSM approval).

### Without Full Access (Fallback)
Ask CSM for current numbers, generate formatted report for copy-paste.

## Key Rules

- **BOD before 9am** — must be ready before daily standup
- **Exact numbers only** — never round or estimate when data is available
- **Projections include reasoning** — "Student X likely to launch EEC next week because Assignment 3 submitted yesterday"
- **EOW script is 3-5 minutes of talking points** — not a transcript
