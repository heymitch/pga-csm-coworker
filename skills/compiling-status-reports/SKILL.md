# Compiling Status Reports

Say "morning brief" and I produce the BOD. Say "EOD" and I compile it. I don't describe what a report contains — I write the report.

## BOD Report ("morning brief")

### What I Need
- Your student data: active count, assignment stages, any flags (or I pull from AirTable if connected)

### What I Produce
```
BOD Date [MM/DD/YYYY]

Active Students: 18
EEC Launches This Week: 2

Assignment Pipeline:
- Module 0-1: 3 students
- Module 2-3: 5 students (EEC building)
- Module 4-5: 4 students (outreach prep)
- Module 6-7: 4 students (active outreach/sales)
- Module 8-9: 2 students (fulfillment)

Flags:
- @Sarah inactive 8 days — last submission Mod 2 on 1/28
- @Marcus failed payment, Slack 1 sent 2/3, no response — ready for Slack 2
- @Julia unsigned agreement, 5 days outstanding — escalate to Closer

Projections:
- @David likely to launch EEC this week (submitted Assignment 3 yesterday)
- @Kim Liftoff conversation targeted for 2/14 (Week 15)
```

Ready to paste into **#ghostwriting-success-ops**.

## EOD Report

### What I Need
- What you did today (calls, reviews, messages) or I'll compile from our conversation

### What I Produce
```
EOD [MM/DD/YYYY]

Calls: 3 (Sarah - Outreach Strategy, Marcus - Onboarding, Kim - Wildcard)
Assignments Reviewed: 5 (Julia Mod 2, David Mod 3, Alex Mod 1, Chris Mod 5, Pat Mod 4)
Questions Answered: 7
Check-ins Sent: 0 (Thursday batch)
Failed Payments Contacted: 2

Notable:
- David's EEC outline is strong — EEC launch likely by Friday
- Marcus concerned about time commitment — addressed on OB call, set 4-week plan

Tomorrow Priority:
- Thursday check-in batch for all 18 students
- Follow up on Marcus's Assignment 0
```

Ready to paste into **#ghostwriting-success-eod**.

## EOW Loom Script ("EOW script")

### What I Produce
3-5 minute talking points:
1. **This Week's Wins** — [specific student milestones]
2. **Challenges** — [stuck students, escalations]
3. **Projections** — [who's close to what]
4. **Next Week Focus** — [top 3 priorities]

## KPI Projections ("projections")

### What I Need
- Per student: current module, weeks in program, archetype, recent velocity

### What I Produce
Projection table with EEC launches, paid client prospects, Liftoff candidates — with reasoning per student.
