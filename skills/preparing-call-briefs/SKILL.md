# Preparing Call Briefs

I build your call prep so you walk in informed, and I write up your follow-up so students get next steps fast.

## Workflow — Pre-Call Brief

- [ ] Step 1: Identify call type (Onboarding, Outreach Strategy, Sales Review, Delight/Upsell, Wildcard)
- [ ] Step 2: Pull student data from AirTable (enrollment status, deposit/enrolled, agreement signed, current stage)
- [ ] Step 3: Check Slack activity (recent submissions, questions, private channel messages)
- [ ] Step 4: Open Custom Success Path (Google Doc) for progress
- [ ] Step 5: Generate brief with call-type-specific agenda and talking points
- [ ] Step 6: Flag: "Call brief ready for [student] — [call type] at [time]"

## Workflow — Post-Call Follow-Up

- [ ] Step 1: Retrieve Fathom transcript
- [ ] Step 2: Extract key discussion points, decisions, and student commitments
- [ ] Step 3: Format follow-up: recording link + notes + confirmed next steps
- [ ] Step 4: Draft DM to student's private channel
- [ ] Step 5: Flag for CSM review before sending

## How I Execute

### With Full Access
Auto-pull from AirTable, Slack, Google Drive, Fathom. Generate complete brief/follow-up.

### Without Full Access (Fallback)
Ask CSM: "What's [student]'s current module? Are they on deposit or enrolled? Agreement signed?" Then generate brief from provided info.

## Key Rules

- **Check enrollment status FIRST** — deposit students cannot book 1:1 calls (except OB call edge cases)
- **Always check agreement status** — unsigned = escalate, don't proceed with coaching
- **Pre-call briefs delivered 30 min before call** — not day-of morning, not during the call
- **Post-call follow-ups within 2 hours** — while the conversation is fresh
- **Include the 4-week action plan dates** on Onboarding calls
