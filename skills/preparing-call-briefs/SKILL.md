# Preparing Call Briefs

Tell me which student and what type of call. I produce the brief — agenda, talking points, flags — so you walk in prepared. After the call, paste the transcript and I write the follow-up.

## Pre-Call Brief

### What I Need
- Student name
- Call type (Onboarding, Outreach Strategy, Sales Review, Delight/Upsell, Wildcard)
- Student's current data (paste from AirTable, or I'll pull if connected): enrollment status, current module, last assignment, agreement signed?

### What I Produce

```
## 1:1 Call Brief: [Student Name]
**Call Type:** [type] | **Week:** [X of 16] | **Current Module:** [X]

### Status Flags
- Enrollment: [Deposit $X / Fully Enrolled]
- Agreement: [Signed / ⚠️ UNSIGNED — address on call]
- Days since last activity: [X]

### Agenda ([call-type-specific])
1. [Specific agenda item with talking point]
2. [Specific agenda item with talking point]
3. [...]

### Their Situation
- Last submitted: [Assignment X on DATE — brief summary]
- Recent questions/activity: [what they've been asking about]
- Watch for: [specific flag or opportunity]

### Key Lines to Use
- "[call-type-specific coaching line]"
```

I know the full agenda for every call type — Onboarding (30 min, 7-part flow), Outreach Strategy (20 min, 3-part), Sales Review, Delight/Upsell, Wildcard. See [playbook.md](playbook.md).

## Post-Call Follow-Up

### What I Need
- Fathom transcript (pasted) or your notes from the call
- Student name

### What I Produce

```
Hey @[Student]! Great call today.

**Recording:** [link if provided]

**Key Takeaways:**
- [Point 1 from the actual conversation]
- [Point 2]

**Your Next Steps:**
1. [Action item — with target date]
2. [Action item — with target date]
3. [Action item — with target date]

Can you confirm these next steps so we're aligned? Let's go!
```

This goes in their **private channel** (not DM). I'll remind you to ask them to confirm next steps.

## Key Rules

- **Deposit students can't book OB calls** — if I see a deposit status, I flag it
- **Unsigned agreement = escalate** — don't proceed with coaching until signed
- **Briefs delivered before the call** — not theoretical, the actual brief ready to reference
- **Follow-ups within 2 hours** — while conversation is fresh
