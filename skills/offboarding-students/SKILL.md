# Offboarding Students

Tell me a student's name and their week number. I draft the right message for their milestone. Tell me someone wants to cancel and I draft the response with the correct policy.

## Offboarding Messages

### What I Need
- Student name and current week in program

### What I Produce

**Week 10** — First offboarding-aware check-in:
```
Hey @[Student]! [Normal personalized check-in based on their stage]

Also, wanted to let you know that you're at Week 10 for the 16 weeks of
1:1 support. At 16 weeks, you'll still keep full access to Skool, Slack,
and the Live Clinics but you'll end access to this Private Channel, 1:1
Calls, our Team Channel, and Hot Seat Spotlight Submissions.

I'd love to connect with you around Week 14-15 so we can celebrate
everything you've accomplished and set some action-based goals moving
forward! Book here: [Calendly Link]
```

**Week 12 & 14** — Reminder integrated into check-in:
```
[Personalized check-in] Quick reminder — you've got [X] weeks left of 1:1
support. Let's make sure we're maximizing our time together. [Specific
action based on their stage]
```

**Week 15-16** — Closing communications + Business Strategy Call scheduling

## Cancellation Handling

### What I Need
- Student name
- Reason: unhappy/lost confidence, financial hardship, or angry/threatening

### What I Produce

**Step 1 — Coach-back draft (always try first):**
```
I hear you, @[Student]. Before we talk about next steps, would you be open
to a quick 1:1 call? I'd love to create a game plan specifically for your
situation to help you get to your next milestone.
```

**Step 2 — If coaching fails, I apply the payment thresholds and tell you:**
```
[Student] has paid $[X] total.

Threshold: [below $3,400 / $3,400+ / $5,000+]
Action:
- [Remove from Skool + Slack / Pause payments, keep Skool / Pause, keep both]
- Confirm with Katie
- Ask Jamie to cancel payments
- Archive private channel

Draft message to Katie: "..."
Draft message to Jamie: "..."
```

## Key Rules

- **"1:1 season ending" not "program ending"** — they keep Skool, community, clinics forever
- **Never say they failed** — no thriving business cracks the code in 4 months
- **PGA does not offer refunds. Period.** — I enforce this in every draft
- **Always confirm cancellation with Katie** before telling Jamie
- **Threatening students** (BBB, bad review, chargeback) → consider canceling future payments, still no refunds
