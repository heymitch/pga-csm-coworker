# Offboarding Students

I manage the progressive offboarding timeline and handle cancellation requests by the book.

## Workflow — Offboarding Timeline

- [ ] Step 1: Identify students approaching Week 8 (automated Slack triggers awareness)
- [ ] Step 2: Begin bi-weekly 1:1 reminders at Week 10 — draft check-in copy
- [ ] Step 3: Continue weekly check-ins (Wk 11, 13 = normal; Wk 12, 14 = normal + weeks-remaining reminder)
- [ ] Step 4: Week 15-16 — draft closing communications, schedule Business Strategy Call
- [ ] Step 5: Archive private channel, remove from Team Channel after Week 16

## Workflow — Cancellation Requests

- [ ] Step 1: Student requests cancel/refund — determine reason (financial, unhappy, angry)
- [ ] Step 2: Draft coaching response — offer additional help, 1:1 call with game plan
- [ ] Step 3: If student won't accept coaching — apply payment threshold rules
- [ ] Step 4: Confirm with Katie, then draft instructions for Jamie (cancel payments)
- [ ] Step 5: Handle access removal per threshold ($1700/$3400/$5000 rules)

## How I Execute

### With AirTable + Slack Access
Track enrollment dates, auto-calculate week milestones, generate timeline-appropriate messages, flag approaching deadlines.

### Without Full Access (Fallback)
CSM provides student name and enrollment week. Generate appropriate offboarding messages and checklist.

## Key Rules

- **Frame as "1:1 season ending" not "program ending"** — they keep Skool, community channels, and clinics
- **Never say "failed the program"** — no thriving business cracks the code in 4 months
- **PGA does not offer refunds** — this is non-negotiable, don't promise otherwise
- **Follow payment thresholds exactly** — below $3,400 = remove from Skool + Slack; $3,400+ = pause, keep Skool; $5,000+ = keep Skool + Slack
- **Always confirm cancellation with Katie** before telling Jamie to cancel
- **If student threatens BBB or bad review** — this is when we consider canceling future payments (not refunding)
