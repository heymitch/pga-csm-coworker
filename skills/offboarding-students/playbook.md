# Offboarding & Cancellation Playbook

## Offboarding Timeline (Week by Week)

### Week 1: Set Expectations
On 1:1 Onboarding Call, explain: "We designed the program to have enhanced support during your first 16 weeks with 1:1 Calls, Private Channel, Team Channel, and Hot Seat Spotlights."

### Weeks 2-7: Build Value
Send Weekly Check-ins every Friday showing the benefit of their private channel. Outreach based on program stage.

### Week 8: Awareness Trigger
Automated Slack from Dickie in private channel mentioning 8-week mark + NPS Survey bump. This is your signal to start thinking about offboarding.

### Week 10: First Reminder
Add to Friday check-in:
```
Also, wanted to let you know that you're at Week 10 for the 16 weeks of 1:1 support. Which means at 16 weeks, you'll still keep full access to Skool, Slack, and the Live Clinics but you'll end access to this Private Channel, 1:1 Calls, our Team Channel, and Hot Seat Spotlight Submissions.

I'd love to connect with you around Week 14-15 so we can celebrate everything you've accomplished in PGA so far and set some action-based goals for you moving forward! You can find a date within the next 6 weeks here: [Calendly Link]
```

### Weeks 11 & 13: Normal Check-in
Standard weekly outreach, no offboarding mention.

### Weeks 12 & 14: Normal + Reminder
Standard check-in + "Quick reminder — you've got [X] weeks left of 1:1 support."

### Weeks 15-16: Closing Communications
- Schedule Business Strategy Call if not already booked
- Communication about closing private channel and removal from team channel
- Archive private channel after final call

## Business Strategy Call (Week 16 or Liftoff-eligible)

### For Students Who Are NOT Liftoff Leads
1. Reflect: What have you accomplished since joining? What was your goal?
2. What made PGA different from other programs?
3. Here's what you keep: Curriculum, community Slack, clinic attendance
4. Here's what you lose: 1:1 coaching, private channel, team channel, hot seat
5. Questions?
6. "Can I give you my synopsis of where I see you're at?" → lead into Liftoff pitch anyway

### For Liftoff-Eligible Students ($5K+ clients landed)
- Proactive upsell conversation before Week 16
- Focus on recurring revenue, continued 1:1 support, private channel

## Framing Rules
- **"1:1 season ending"** not "program ending"
- **Never say they "failed"** — no thriving business cracks the code in 4 months
- They're never NOT "in the program" — they keep Skool, community, clinics
- Simply the end of 1:1 support unless they want Liftoff

## Cancellation & Refund Handling

### Step 1: Understand the Reason
- **Unhappy/lost confidence:** Coach them to stay — offer additional 1:1 call with game plan
- **Financial hardship:** Apply payment threshold rules (see below)
- **Angry/threatening:** Apply escalation protocol

### Step 2: Coach Back (Always Try First)
"I hear you. Before we talk about next steps, would you be open to a quick 1:1 call? I'd love to create a game plan specifically for your situation to help you get to your next milestone."

### Step 3: Apply Payment Thresholds (if coaching fails)

**Paid below 50% (less than $3,400):**
- Remove from Skool AND Slack
- Cancel future payments (Jamie)

**Paid 50%+ ($3,400 or more):**
- Pause payments until they can pay
- Keep Skool access
- Lose Slack access

**Paid $5,000+:**
- Pause payments until they can pay
- Keep Skool AND Slack access
- Lose: private channel, 1:1 calls, hot seat submissions

**Keep Skool threshold:** If paid $1,700+ with cancelled future payments → keep Skool

### Step 4: Execute Cancellation
1. CSM confirms un-enrollment with Katie
2. CSM asks Jamie Runion to cancel payments
3. CSM removes from Slack and archives private channel
4. CSM confirms with Katie re: Skool access per thresholds

### Threatening Students (BBB, bad review, credit card chargeback)
- This is when we **consider** canceling future payments
- Still NO refunds on payments already made
- PGA does not offer refunds — per the Program Agreement they signed

**Bottom line: PGA does not offer refunds. Period.**
