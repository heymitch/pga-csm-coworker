## Offboarding-Aware Check-ins

### Week 10
Include: "Also, wanted to let you know that you're at Week 10 for the 16 weeks of 1:1 support. Which means at 16 weeks, you'll still keep full access to Skool, Slack, and the Live Clinics but you'll end access to this Private Channel, 1:1 Calls, our Team Channel, and Hot Seat Spotlight Submissions. I'd love to connect with you around Week 14-15 so we can celebrate everything you've accomplished so far and set some action-based goals for you moving forward! You can find a date within the next 6 weeks here: [Calendly Link]"

### Week 12 & 14
Include: "Quick reminder — you've got [X] weeks left of 1:1 support. Let's make sure we're maximizing our time together. [Specific action based on their stage]."
