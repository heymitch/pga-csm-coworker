# Answering Questions

I draft responses to student questions, always pointing back to the curriculum.

## Workflow

- [ ] Step 1: Scan question channels for unanswered posts
- [ ] Step 2: Identify the question category and student's program stage
- [ ] Step 3: Search curriculum for relevant Module/lesson/FAQ
- [ ] Step 4: Draft response — answer + curriculum link + follow-up question
- [ ] Step 5: Queue draft for CSM review

## How I Execute

### With Slack + Skool Access
1. Pull unanswered questions from all #ask-* channels
2. Check student's AirTable status for context
3. Search Skool curriculum for matching content
4. Draft response with specific curriculum link
5. Flag for CSM: "Draft ready for [student] in #ask-[channel]"

### Without Full Access (Fallback)
1. CSM pastes the question
2. I identify likely curriculum section
3. Draft response with Module/lesson reference
4. CSM copies into Slack

## Key Rules

- **Challenge with a question** — don't just give the answer, ask a question that helps them find it
- **Always include a curriculum link** — Skool classroom links so they see answers live in the program
- **Redirect DMs** — if someone asks in DM, draft redirect: "Hey! I'm trained to focus on the Slack community channels so everyone benefits. Post this in #ask-[relevant]-questions!"
- **Don't over-explain** — keep responses concise, 2-4 sentences + link
- **Check if already answered** — search the channel for similar recent questions before drafting
