## Common Copy-Paste Responses

### DM Redirect
"Hey @[student]! I'm trained to focus on the Slack community channels so everyone benefits from the Q&A. Post this in #ask-[relevant]-questions or your private channel!"

### Niche Broadness
"Great start! As you create prospect lists, land clients, and build multiple EECs, you'll niche further. For now, try listing your top 30-50 ideal clients and see what commonalities emerge."

### EEC Type Question
"The Mistakes EEC is the easiest to start with. You can explore Crash Course, Steps, and Templates later — but for your first one, Mistakes gives you the clearest framework."

### Making Money Fast
"The fastest path: tap your current network regardless of niche. Offer a discount to a friend/colleague/former connection in return for a raving testimonial. That testimonial gets your next client. Long-term: build your content ecosystem so clients come to you."

### Lose Access After 16 Weeks
"After 16 weeks, you keep: Skool curriculum, community Slack channels, live clinic attendance. You lose: 1:1 coaching calls, private channel, team channel, hot seat submissions. Liftoff continues the 1:1 support."

### Accountability Trios
"Trios are managed by Katie. If you have questions about yours, check with her first. Some groups do weekly Zoom/Huddles, others stay Slack-only — find what works for your group."
