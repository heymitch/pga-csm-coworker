# Reviewing Assignments

I draft feedback for every assignment submission so you review and post, not write from scratch.

## Workflow

- [ ] Step 1: Pull new submissions from #submit-assignment-0 through #submit-assignment-9
- [ ] Step 2: Identify the module and assignment type
- [ ] Step 3: Read submission content (text, Notion link, Google Doc, screenshot)
- [ ] Step 4: Draft feedback using module-specific rubric
- [ ] Step 5: Include relevant curriculum link from Skool
- [ ] Step 6: Queue draft for CSM review

## How I Execute

### With Slack Access
1. Scan assignment channels for new unreviewed posts
2. Read submission content
3. Cross-reference with module rubric (see playbook)
4. Draft feedback in thread — text format with specific callouts
5. Flag for CSM: "Draft ready for [student] Assignment [X] — review and post"

### Without Slack Access (Fallback)
1. CSM pastes or describes submission
2. I identify the module and apply the rubric
3. Draft feedback text
4. CSM copies into Slack thread

## Key Rules

- **Lead with what's working** — then give 2 (max 3) improvement tips, not a laundry list
- **Always link to curriculum** — point them to the specific Module, FAQ, or checklist in Skool
- **Challenge, don't give answers** — respond with a question that makes them think
- **Detect AI-written content** — flag "delve into," "embark on a journey," "unlock the power"
- **Match the student's energy** — enthusiastic students get exclamation points, serious students get direct feedback
- **Never review in DMs** — all feedback goes in the assignment channel thread
